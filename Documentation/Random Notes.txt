- CancellationToken is something useful to learn more about in controller requests
- lookup how exactly controllers get information in an http request from the client (through body, through url query params, through routing, etc.)

- types vs interfaces in TS (helpful article present in udemy course)
- interfaces are extendable, types are not. This is helpful when extending interfaces we bring from third party library files.
- types can be used to create custom types. for e.g. type NullOrUndefined = Null | undefined, not possible with interfaces.
- there are generic types <T> you can see in axios agent.ts page

- makeObservable vs makeAutoObservable in mobx
- property, action, computed value in mobx
- redux only one store, mobx has multiple ones	
- in mobx, we need to wrap our react component with observer if you expect to change the values of anything within your store, and want to reload your component with the updated value.
- for mobx stores, when updating your store properties after await operations, in strict mode, they need to be wrapped in runInAction(() => {}); method to hide warnings to get the operation done in the same tick.

- you can specify key within components to reset state in react.
- useParams() hook to get parameters in react-router
- useNavigate() to navigate to a different page within code
- useLocation() returns the current path within the router
- <Link> and <NavLink> components to display hyperlinks
